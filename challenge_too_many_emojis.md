**Description:**
I enjoy using emojis in my text messages, but my friend might have gone a bit overboard. 💀 Can you figure out what she’s trying to tell me? 🤔
Category: OstInt

**Analysis:**
The challenge presents a PNG image containing a sequence of emojis and characters. The goal is to decode the hidden message within the emojis.

**Solution:**
Extract the Emojis:
The first step is to extract the emojis from the image. This can be done manually or with the assistance of tools like OCR (Optical Character Recognition) or ChatGPT. If done manually, you can use resources like Emojipedia to identify each emoji and its corresponding English name.

Identify the Emoji Names:
Each emoji has a unique name in English. By extracting the initials of these names, you can decode the hidden message. For example:

💔 = Broken Heart

😌 = Relieved Face

👹 = Ogre

🤢 = Nauseated Face

😖 = Confounded Face

👹 = Ogre
